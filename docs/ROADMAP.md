# Quick Aside — Roadmap v0.2

Roadmap milestones are product outcomes, not branch/PR units. Each milestone should be delivered through small reviewable changes.

## M0 — Project foundation

Outcome: repository boots, builds, tests, and has canonical project/design context.

Likely changes:

- project bootstrap + Compose/Room/test baseline;
- design system/navigation shell;
- core domain contracts.

## M1 — Local capture and memory core

Outcome: the app is useful locally without Google/AI dependencies.

Capabilities:

- text capture;
- basic voice/STT capture;
- editable transcript;
- lists (Mandado/Compras);
- notes;
- basic structured logs;
- action ledger/undo foundation;
- local search/history basics;
- UI aligned with UX v3.

## M2 — AI interpretation and fast-capture flow

Outcome: natural-language input becomes validated structured actions with minimal friction.

Capabilities:

- typed CapturePlan schema;
- MiMo-V2.5 provider integration;
- low-confidence policy;
- optional DeepSeek V4 Flash fallback;
- adaptive receipt;
- optional edit/review branch;
- correction/routing examples.

## M3 — Google Tasks + Calendar

Outcome: Personal/Trabajo tasks and events synchronize reliably with Google.

Capabilities:

- OAuth/scopes;
- Google Tasks mapping + bidirectional sync;
- Calendar integration + incremental sync where applicable;
- offline outbox/retry;
- conflict/idempotency policy;
- real-account QA.

Because sync can create data-loss/idempotency risk, break this milestone into small high-confidence changes and elevate governance where required.

## M4 — Reminders and daily reliability

Outcome: user-configured reminders reliably fire and are actionable.

Capabilities:

- Note/Task local reminders;
- snooze;
- notification actions;
- restart/background/idle behavior;
- real-device QA.

## M5 — Durable history, backup, and archive

Outcome: years of personal memory can be recovered/exported without silent loss.

Capabilities:

- backup/snapshot foundation;
- export center;
- reimportable structured format;
- human-readable PDF/DOCX export;
- archive warnings;
- verified archive-before-prune contract.

## M6 — Personal MVP polish

Outcome: the user can adopt Quick Aside as the default capture tool in everyday life.

Capabilities driven by observed usage:

- latency/friction polish;
- one-handed/accessibility refinement;
- sync/reminder edge-case hardening;
- search/retrieval improvements;
- UI polish against canonical reference;
- real usage acceptance period.

## Post-MVP — Evidence-triggered candidates

Likely early:

- Quick Settings capture tile.
- Home widget.
- Share-to-Quick Aside.
- richer history queries.
- recurring/multiple reminders.

Later only if evidence supports them:

- FCM remote notifications / agent integrations;
- on-device local model/routing;
- cross-device cloud sync;
- lock-screen capture;
- Wear OS;
- system overlays;
- hardware-button invocation;
- shared lists/collaboration.

Do not implement these simply because they are listed here.
